SUDOKU SOLVER PROJECT
---------------------
Project Description
---------------------
This python project contains a series of functions which solve a 9x9 sudoku board using a simple backtracking algorithm,
as well as a default sudoku board and its solution.
As of now, the unsolved board must be input in the form of a list of lists (aka an array of arrays), and all user interaction
is intended for use in the command line.

sudoku.py - Collection of functions that allows for solving a sudoku board, along with a default board and solution.
gui.py - Code for GUI with pygame (currently empty).
readme.txt - You're lookin' at it!

Future Updates
---------------------
Future updates may include more functionality such as:
Friendlier user interface/GUI.
Returning whether or not a given board is actually solvable.
Returning whether or not a given board is uniquely solvable.
Randomly generating uniquely solvable sudoku boards.
A functional sudoku app, to allow users to play sudoku.
Functionality for different sudoku board dimensions (e.g. 3x3).
Algorithm visualization.
Better solving algorithm.
